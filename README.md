# Bank Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

In the competitive landscape of banking, understanding customers is pivotal for offering personalized services and products. The Bank Customer Segmentation Project harnesses the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to segment bank customers into distinct groups based on various attributes such as demographics, transaction behaviors, and product usage. This project employs advanced machine learning techniques to analyze customer data, identify patterns, and segment customers in a way that can significantly enhance targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and increase overall customer satisfaction.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive AI solution that enables banks to:

- Understand the diverse needs and preferences of their customer base.
- Tailor banking products and services to meet the specific needs of different customer segments.
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with each customer segment.
- Enhance customer engagement and loyalty by delivering personalized experiences.
- Drive business growth by identifying and capitalizing on opportunities within specific segments.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and preparation of banking data for analysis, including handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.
- **Customer Profiling:** Comprehensive analysis of customer data to generate profiles based on demographics, transaction history, and product preferences.
- **Segmentation Models:** Implementation of various clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to segment customers into meaningful groups.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use of silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and other metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of different segmentation strategies.
- **Visualization Tools:** Interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore the characteristics of different customer segments and their behaviors.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Integration of predictive models to forecast future trends within each customer segment and identify cross-sell and up-sell opportunities.
- **Features Dimensions Reduction:** Using various models to reduce the dimensionality of the features by UMAP and T-SNE.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing different machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and documentation.
